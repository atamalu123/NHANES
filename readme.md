# Background

As stated on [the website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about/):

"The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collects data about the health of adults and children in the United States. We also collect data about what participants eat, drink, and take as supplements to determine how many nutrients are in their diet. These dietary interviews and blood tests help us measure the nutritional status of U.S. adults and children."

# Summary

[My analysis on water intake](https://github.com/atamalu123/NHANES/blob/main/water_intake.md) found no significant differences in average water intake
  * Between genders
  * Between races
  * Between education levels
  * Across ages
  
I also examined the BMI-water intake relationship and found slight significance after controlling for age, race, gender, and income-to-poverty ratio. The effect size, however, was very small.

I also found that water intake did not play a role in feeling depressed or overall tiredness.
